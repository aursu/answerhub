Shared Library Files

Like most servlet containers, Tomcat also supports mechanisms to install
library JAR files (or unpacked classes) once, and make them visible to all
installed web applications (without having to be included inside the web
application itself). The details of how Tomcat locates and shares such classes
are described in the [Class Loader HOW-TO](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html)
documentation. The location commonly used within a Tomcat installation for
shared code is $CATALINA_HOME/lib. JAR files placed here are visible both to
web applications and internal Tomcat code. This is a good place to put JDBC
drivers that are required for both your application or internal Tomcat use
(such as for a JDBCRealm).

Out of the box, a standard Tomcat installation includes a variety of pre-
installed shared library files, including:

The Servlet 3.0 and JSP 2.2 APIs that are fundamental to writing servlets and
JavaServer Pages.
